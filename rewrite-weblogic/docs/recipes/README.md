# Rewrite WebLogic recipes

Look here for detailed information about each of the following Rewrite WebLogic composite recipes (recipes that consist of a list of other recipes). Depending on your application dependencies and WebLogic Server and JDK source versions, you can use one or more recipes to accomplish your goals.

For detailed information about running recipes, see [How to run recipes](../procedures/README.md) and the [WebLogic Examples and Tutorials](https://github.com/oracle-samples/weblogic-examples) repository.

> [!NOTE]
> These recipes do not address _any_ other third-party dependencies. For all other third-party dependencies, you _must_ find or create an additional [recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes) to do the migration, or make manual code changes after the migration.
